# Dnd
A program to create, organize, and edit DM materials for a Dnd Campaign. 

This is a project that I started as a practice piece to get back into working in Java. It's nothing fancy, just a console-based text 
game that allows the user to quickly build, customize, and edit an imaginary world for the purpose of a D&D campaign. I came up with this
idea because a I play D&D with a group of friends, and I was elected as the next DM. Having never done so before, I wanted a way in which
I could amass and keep track of all of the information I would need to in order to actually run a campaign. I'm sure I could've just
downloaded someone else's program that did the same and more, but I am also in desperate need of practice using Java, Eclipse, and Git, 
so I thought this would be the perfect way to get back in the game and have some fun along the way.
